# snippets ✂️✂️

random stuff i've coded that probably don't deserve their own repositories. 

### cryptography challenge
inspired by the ncss cryptography challenge, but more badly written and w/ only two "ciphers". try not to use tools, it's more fun trying to work it out based on dates and word lengths  :"D 

fetches a random wikipedia article and scrapes its title and body paragraphs, the latter of which is then encrypted using caesar ciphering (more ciphers to come). enter the exact name of the article (case sensitive) to earn a point. 
- [cryptography/cipherhelp.py](https://github.com/phthallo/snippets/blob/main/cryptography/cipherhelp.py) exists as a tool to help speed up substitutions, just replace the '-' in the [cryptography/dict.json](https://github.com/phthallo/snippets/blob/main/cryptography/dict.json) file with what you suspect the letters to be and the tool will perform the substitutions automatically. 
- [cryptography/commonletters.py](https://github.com/phthallo/snippets/blob/main/cryptography/commonletters.py) takes input and determines the top five most common letters + their percentage frequency.

### graphics
small python programs for my casio cg50 au graphics calculator to make my life easier
- [graphics/commonfactors.py](https://github.com/phthallo/snippets/blob/main/graphics/commonfactors.py) finds common factors of two integers, planning to expand it more.
- [graphics/factors.py](https://github.com/phthallo/snippets/blob/main/graphics/factors.py) lists all factors of an integer.

### toyhouse [wip]
program that's meant to evaluate whether any of your characters are in another user's favourited characters. authentication completed <- this is required because some characters are set to auth-only or hidden from guests 

### twilioquest 
cleared out some of my documents and found my twilioquest solutions from late last year (python and javascript)
