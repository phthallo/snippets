random stuff i've coded that probably don't deserve their own repositories. 

### cryptography challenge
inspired by the ncss cryptography challenge, but more badly written and w/ only one cipher. try not to use tools, it's more fun trying to work it out based on dates and word lengths  :"D 

fetches a random wikipedia article and scrapes its title and body paragraphs, the latter of which is then encrypted using caesar ciphering (more ciphers to come). enter the exact name of the article (case sensitive) to earn a point. 
- [cryptography/cipherhelp.py](https://github.com/phthallo/snippets/blob/main/cryptography/cipherhelp.py) exists as a tool to help speed up substitutions, just replace the '-' in the [cryptography/dict.json](https://github.com/phthallo/snippets/blob/main/cryptography/dict.json) file with what you suspect the letters to be and the tool will perform the substitutions automatically. 
- [cryptography/commonletters.py](https://github.com/phthallo/snippets/blob/main/cryptography/commonletters.py) takes input and determines the top five most common letters + their percentage frequency.
